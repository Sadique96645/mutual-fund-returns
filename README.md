### Project Overview

 The data given is of the mutual funds in USA. The objective of this problem is to predict the ‘basis point spread’ over AAA bonds i.e. feature ‘bonds_aaa’ against each Serial Number.
Basis Point Spread indicates the additional return a mutual fund would give over the AAA rated bonds.
The original data contains many non numerical features and missing values. We will be learning how to handle these cases in future concepts, for this project we have processed the data for you so that you can concentrate on building model.


### Learnings from the project
